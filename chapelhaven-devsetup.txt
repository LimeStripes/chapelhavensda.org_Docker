Who We Are
The Chapel Haven Seventh-day Adventist Church seeks to enhance quality of life for all people in the Northglenn community, adhering to the ideals described by the Bible. We seek to share both our faith in God and the church’s commitment to the betterment of all human beings.


As Adventists, we believe that God is concerned with the quality of human life, and that everything—the way we live, eat, speak, think, treat each other, and care for the world around us—is a part of His plan. Our families, our children, our jobs, our talents, our money, and our time are all important to Him.


We are a mainstream Protestant church with approximately 21 million members worldwide and more than one million members in North America. Our doors are always open to the community and to anyone who wishes to worship in one of our more than 151,000 Seventh-day Adventist congregations around the world.
